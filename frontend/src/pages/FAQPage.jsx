      questions: [
        {
          question: 'What is the best time to visit Marrakech?',
          answer: 'The best time to visit Marrakech is during spring (March-May) and fall (September-November) when temperatures are mild and comfortable. Summer can be very hot (40Â°C+), while winter nights can be quite cool. Spring offers beautiful weather and blooming gardens, while fall provides warm days and cool evenings perfect for exploring.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How many days should I spend in Marrakech?',
          answer: 'We recommend at least 3-4 days to see the main attractions and get a feel for the city. A week allows you to explore more thoroughly, take day trips to nearby areas like the Atlas Mountains or Essaouira, and truly immerse yourself in the local culture. For a comprehensive experience including cooking classes and cultural activities, 5-7 days is ideal.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Is Marrakech safe for tourists?',
          answer: 'Yes, Marrakech is generally safe for tourists. The city has a strong tourism police presence and locals are generally welcoming to visitors. However, like any tourist destination, stay aware of your surroundings, avoid displaying expensive items, and be cautious of common tourist scams. The medina can be overwhelming at first, so consider hiring a guide for your first visit.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What should I wear in Marrakech?',
          answer: 'Dress modestly and respectfully, especially when visiting religious sites. For women, cover shoulders and knees; for men, avoid shorts in religious areas. Lightweight, breathable fabrics are best due to the climate. Comfortable walking shoes are essential for navigating the medina\'s uneven surfaces. Bring layers as temperatures can vary significantly between day and night.'

      questions: [
        {
          question: 'What are the must-try dishes in Marrakech?',
          answer: 'Essential dishes include tagine (slow-cooked stew), couscous (traditionally served on Fridays), pastilla (sweet and savory pastry), harira (hearty soup), and mint tea. Don\'t miss street food like msemen (flaky pancakes), chebakia (honey cookies), and fresh orange juice from Jemaa el-Fnaa. Each dish tells a story of Moroccan culture and tradition.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Is street food safe to eat?',
          answer: 'Street food can be safe if you choose wisely. Look for busy stalls with high turnover, hot freshly cooked food, and clean preparation areas. Avoid raw vegetables, unpeeled fruits you didn\'t peel yourself, and anything that\'s been sitting out. Trust your instincts - if something doesn\'t look or smell right, skip it. Our reviews highlight the safest and most delicious street food options.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Are there vegetarian/vegan options available?',
          answer: 'Yes! Moroccan cuisine offers many vegetarian options including vegetable tagines, couscous with vegetables, lentil dishes, and fresh salads. Many restaurants can prepare vegan versions of traditional dishes. However, be aware that some seemingly vegetarian dishes may contain meat stock, so always ask. We have a dedicated section for vegetarian and vegan-friendly restaurants.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How much should I tip at restaurants?',
          answer: 'Tipping 10-15% is standard at restaurants if service charge isn\'t included. For casual dining or cafes, rounding up the bill or leaving small change is sufficient. At street food stalls, tipping isn\'t expected but appreciated. For exceptional service, feel free to tip more. Always check if service charge is already included in your bill.'

        },
        {
          question: 'Can I cancel or modify my booking?',

Check the specific terms when booking. We always recommend booking flexible rates when possible. Contact us immediately if you need to make changes, and we\'ll help coordinate with the venue.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Do you charge booking fees?',
          answer: 'We don\'t charge additional booking fees for most reservations. The price you see is the price you pay. Some premium experiences or last-minute bookings may have small processing fees, which will be clearly displayed before you confirm. We believe in transparent pricing with no hidden surprises.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What if the restaurant is closed when I arrive?',
          answer: 'While rare, if a restaurant is unexpectedly closed, contact us immediately. We\'ll help you find alternative dining options and work with the establishment to reschedule or refund your booking. We maintain close relationships with our partners to minimize such issues and ensure your experience remains positive.'

We don\'t accept payment for positive reviews - our recommendations are based solely on merit and personal experience.'

If we receive reports of significant changes, we prioritize re-visiting those places. Menu changes, price updates, and service quality shifts are reflected in our reviews. Follow our social media for real-time updates and new discoveries.'

          answer: 'We accept all major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express), PayPal, and bank transfers for our services. For restaurant and activity bookings, payment methods vary by establishment. Most accept credit cards, but some local places may be cash-only. We always indicate payment methods accepted on each listing.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Are prices shown in local currency?',
          answer: 'Prices are typically shown in Moroccan Dirhams (MAD) with USD/EUR equivalents for reference. Exchange rates are updated regularly, but actual charges may vary slightly based on your bank\'s exchange rate. We recommend checking current exchange rates before your trip and budgeting accordingly.'
        },

        {
          question: 'What are important cultural customs to know?',
          answer: 'Respect local customs by dressing modestly, especially in religious areas. Remove shoes when entering mosques or traditional homes. Use your right hand for eating and greeting. During Ramadan, be respectful of those fasting. Learn basic Arabic/French greetings - locals appreciate the effort. Bargaining is expected in souks but be respectful and fair.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Is it appropriate to take photos of people?',
          answer: 'Always ask permission before photographing people, especially in traditional dress or working. Many people in tourist areas may expect a small tip for photos. Avoid photographing people praying or in religious contexts. Street performers in Jemaa el-Fnaa often expect payment for photos. Respect privacy and cultural sensitivities.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What languages are spoken in Marrakech?',
          answer: 'Arabic and Berber (Amazigh) are official languages. French is widely spoken due to colonial history. In tourist areas, many people speak English, Spanish, and Italian. Learning basic Arabic phrases like "Shukran" (thank you) and "Salam" (hello) is appreciated. Most restaurant menus in tourist areas are multilingual.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How should I handle haggling in the souks?',
          answer: 'Haggling is part of the culture and expected in souks. Start by offering 30-50% of the asking price and negotiate from there. Be patient, friendly, and prepared to walk away - this often leads to better prices. Don\'t haggle if you\'re not seriously interested in buying. Fixed-price shops will display "Prix Fixe" signs.'
